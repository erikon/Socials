# Socials
MDB Mini-Project 3/4

Socials is a Social Networking Application that allows users to create posts of "Socials" or events. After users create an account and log in, they can view a list of all the socials in the database, click on them for more detailed information on that particular social, or they can add/post a social themselves. Additionally, after users click on social to the more detailed page, there are two more buttons that can be pressed. One marks the current user as "interested" in the event, and the other displays a list of all the other users who are interested in the event. 

The core concepts used in this application include the following:
  - Firebase
    - Database
    - Storage
    - Authentication
    - Transactions  
  - Recylcer Views
  - Model Classes
  - Drawer Views
  - Async Tasks
  
 **Note:** Still working on implementing designs.
